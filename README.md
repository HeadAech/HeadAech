# Status

🔭 I’m currently working on a <b>game engine</b> and a game made in it.
<br>
🌱 I’m currently learning OpenGL and rendering principles.

# Try my games

Please kindly take a look at games I've had a pleasure to work on.

## Celestial Gambit ♟️

A local multiplayer game I've made with my team on "Game programming" course. It's based on a game called "Archon: The Light and the Dark". You'll need gamepads to play.
<br/>
It's a mix of two genres - strategy and arcade. **Why?** ... *you'll have to find out*...

## Beyond The Veil 🔍

A detective story-driven game I've made with my team for ZTGK competition at Lodz University of Technology. It's best experienced with headphones on.
